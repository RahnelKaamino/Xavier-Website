                Xavier University is a thriving educational and creative community 
                comprised of more than 15,000 people, situated at the heart of the
                City of Golden Friendship. Life at Xavier Ateneo brings exciting 
                adventures and new experiences every day together with competent, 
                conscientious, and committed Ateneans who are “men and women for others.” </p>
                
                
            <p class="text-font3"> With more than 70 co-curricular and extra-curricular organizations 
                to choose from at Xavier, there is definitely something to pique 
                your interest — from college councils to theater companies, to 
                humanitarian missions and campus journalism, among others. Meet other 
                students with the same interests as you do. Share your talents and 
                skills to the community. Make a difference with your leadership skills 
                and passion for community development with fellow civic-minded students. 
                Get involved with community formation projects, internships, and leadership opportunities.
                Pursue your spiritual practice here at XU where interreligious 
                understanding and promotion of faith and justice are parts of our 
                academic and sociocultural discourses. Xavier Ateneo offers venues 
                where you can reflect, discern, and cultivate your relationship with God.
