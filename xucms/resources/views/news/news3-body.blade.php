                No less than Xavier Ateneo College of Law Dean Silvia Jo Sabio has confirmed that the city’s local
                chief executive will be part of Xavier Ateneo’s faculty, when the new school year begins by August.<br><bR>
                “I am confirming that outgoing Mayor Oscar S Moreno is joining the faculty of the College of Law of
                Xavier Ateneo starting SY2022-2023.  It is an honor that he will teach our students and we are proud

                This came after Mayor Moreno issued a statement during an interview with the media at the recent Charter
                Day celebration of the city of Cagayan de Oro, that among the things he will do when his terms ends this
                month, is to go back to teaching.<br> <br>



                Prior to his political career spanning 24 years, Mayor Moreno was a corporate lawyer and rose to national
                prominence when he served as one of the House prosecutors in the impeachment trial of then-president
                Joseph Estrada.<br><br>
                Mayor Moreno received his formal education in Xavier University-Ateneo de Cagayan before going to law school
                in Manila. By June 30, Moreno would turn over the leadership of Cagayan de Oro to a new mayor, Representative
                Rolando “Klarex” Uy of the city’s 1st District.<br><br>
